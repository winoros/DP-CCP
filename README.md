A implementation of `DP by component pair` which is introduced in `Analysis of Two Existing and One New DynamicProgramming Algorithm for the Generation of OptimalBushy Join Trees without Cross Products`.

`checker.cpp` checks whether its output is valid.

`gen.cpp` generates random test data.

`handmade-in`, `list`, `circle`, `star` and `clique` is the test data constructed manually.
